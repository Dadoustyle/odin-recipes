        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Buffalo wing sauce</li>
            <li>1 refrigerated pizza dough</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 410 degrees F (210 degrees C). 
                Grease a pizza pan.
            </li>

            <li>
                Place chicken into a large pot and cover with 
                salted water; bring to a boil. 
                Cook the chicken breasts until no longer 
                pink in the center and the juices run clear, 
                about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted into the center should read at least
                 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer 
                 chicken to a bowl and shred with two forks.
            </li>

            <li>
                Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Cook and stir chicken and Buffalo wing sauce in 
                 the hot butter until chicken is coated and heated 
                 through, 2 to 4 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Turn pizza dough out onto a generously floured surface.
                 Roll dough into a 12-inch round. Brush dough with
                  1 tablespoon vegetable oil and spread 1 cup 
                  mozzarella cheese in the center of the dough, 
                  leaving a 1-inch border.
                   Spread chicken mixture over cheese; 
                top chicken mixture with remaining 1 cup cheese.
            </li>

            <li>
                Fold pizza dough in half and pinch edges together to seal.
                 Transfer calzone to prepared pizza pan 
                 and brush top with remaining 1 tablespoon oil.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until crust 
                is golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
