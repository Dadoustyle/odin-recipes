        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty 
                lasagna has sweet Italian sausage <em>and</em> 
                lean ground beef.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and
                 two cloves of garlic are cooked with the 
                 meat to add tons of flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of
                 crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, 
                 and two cans of tomato paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white
                 sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the 
                 flavor of the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna 
                recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, 
                dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or 
                homemade lasagna noodles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella,
                 and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so
                it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3 class="title">How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3></p>
        <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can 
            expect when you make homemade lasagna.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
            <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><h3 class="title">Hot to Layer Lasagna</h3></p>

        <p>This is the order you'll follow:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Meat sauce</li>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
            <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
            <li>Meat sauce</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Permesan.</li>
        </ol>

        <P><h3 class="title">How Long the Cook Lasagna</h3></P>
        <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50
             minutes to cook in an oven preheated 
             to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for 
             the first 25 minutes, then let it cook
             uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also,
             it's important to let the lasagna rest at 
             room temperature for about 15 minutes before 
             you cut into it.
